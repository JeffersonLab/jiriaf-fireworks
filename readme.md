# JRM Launcher

JRM Launcher is a tool designed to manage and launch Job Resource Manager (JRM) instances across various computing environments, with a focus on facilitating complex network connections in distributed computing setups.

## Network Architecture

The core functionality of JRM Launcher revolves around managing network connections between different components of a distributed computing environment. The network architecture is visually represented in the [jrm-network.png](jrm-network.png) file included in this repository.
